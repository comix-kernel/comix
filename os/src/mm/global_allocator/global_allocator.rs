//! Global allocator module
//!
//! This module provides dynamic heap memory allocation functionality using the talc allocator.
//!
//! # Components
//!
//! - Global heap allocator based on talc::Talck
//! - Heap memory region defined by linker symbols
//! - Initialization function to set up the heap

use talc::{Span, Talc, Talck};

/// Global heap allocator instance
///
/// Uses talc's lock-based allocator (Talck) with our custom `RawSpinLockWithoutGuard`.
/// This lock implements `lock_api::RawMutex` and provides interrupt protection
/// to prevent deadlocks when interrupt handlers allocate memory.
///
/// Initialized with an empty span; actual memory will be claimed in init_heap().

/// Initialize the heap allocator with the heap memory region defined in linker script
///
/// This function must be called early in the boot process, after BSS clearing
/// but before any heap allocations are attempted.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// - Must be called exactly once during boot
/// - Must be called before any heap allocations
/// - Heap region defined by linker symbols (sheap, eheap) must be valid
